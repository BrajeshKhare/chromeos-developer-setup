{"name":"Chromeos-developer-setup","tagline":"A developer setup guide for Chrome OS (Chromebooks).","body":"_I've recently switched to Chromebook as my main laptop. I have come across several different possible options available to developers. I have detailed them below._\r\n\r\n**First things first, turn off [OS verification](#turn-off-os-verification-on-chromebooks). After you turn off OS verification, all of the below are now open to you as options:**\r\n\r\n## Option 1: Ultra-minimalist Setup\r\n\r\n* **Description**: Use Chrome OS terminal to access Linux 3.4 environment and install a package manger for minimalist dev box. \r\n* **Time to Complete**: 5 - 10 minutes.\r\n* **How**:\r\n  * Open developer's console (crosh terminal) by pressing **<ctrl> + <alt> + t**\r\n  * Type in **shell**\r\n  * You are now able to work with the Linux environment. For development purposes, this probably means Vi & SSH'ing to a remote server.\r\n  * If you are feeling too limited but don't want to install Ubuntu or the like, try Option 2. \r\n  * Recommended: you can install Chromebrew, the Chrome OS package manager. \r\n  * It will provide several useful packages such as make, git, python, ruby, vim, openssl, curl, etc. Full list can be found here.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Option 2: ChrUbuntu Setup\r\n\r\n* **Description**: Dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 and Chrome OS separately. I have found this to be more tedious to initially setup and more suited for those who prefer to boot into one OS at a time. \r\n* **Time to Complete**: 15 - 30 minutes\r\n* **How**: \r\n  * Follow this excellent [tutorial](http://chromeos-cr48.blogspot.com/2012/04/chrubuntu-1204-now-with-double-bits.html)  \r\n  * If you want to install Ubuntu on an SD card [follow this tutorial](http://chromeos-cr48.blogspot.com/2012/12/so-you-want-chrubuntu-on-external-drive.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Option 3: Crouton Setup\r\n\r\n* **Description**: To me, this is the best option because it involves just one command to install, immediate switching between Chrome OS & Ubuntu. Also allows you to combine Option 1 with this option.\r\n* **Time To Install**: 20 - 30 minutes\r\n* **How**:\r\n  * Download crouton here via chrome.\r\n  * Open developer's console (crosh terminal) by pressing <ctrl> + <alt> + t\r\n  * Type in shell\r\n  * Run the installation \r\n  * For XFCE type in: sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce\r\n  * For Unity type in: sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t unity\r\n  * Near the end of the installation, you will be asked to pick a username and password. Now you should be able to switch between Chrome OS and Ubuntu seamlessly. To switch to Ubuntu: \r\n    * If you installed unity, run **sudo startunity** \r\n    * If you installed xkfce, run **sudo startxfce4**\r\n    * Shortcut for switching OSes for ARM based Chromebook: **<ctrl>+<alt>+<shift>+<forward> (F2)** \r\n      * Replace the back key (F1) with the forward key (F2) to switch back\r\n    * Shortcut for switching OSes for Intel based Chromebook: **<ctrl> + <alt> + <back> (F1)**\r\n      * Replace the back key (F1) with the forward key (F2) to switch back.\r\n\r\n## Option 4: The Cloud \"Koder\" Setup\r\n\r\n  * **Description**: This option relies on using an online service koding.com that hosts free VMs for you which you can access via a very nice web interface and a chrome app called terminal. I plan on writing a short blog post on this setup soon.\r\n  * **Time**: 5 - 10 Minutes\r\n  * **How**:\r\n    * Sign up at koding.com for a free account. You will get an Ubuntu virtual machine and a sub-domain name.\r\n    * Install the terminal chrome app. Once installed, open it. It will allow you to access your Koding VM right from a browser tab with a full-page terminal application. \r\n    * I have also heard great things about nitrous.io as an alternative, however I have not personally tried it myself.\r\n\r\n## Option 5: Windows on Chrome OS\r\n\r\n  * **Description**: I have not tried this yet but I have heard this is possible and in the works. Expect more on this topic soon.\r\n  * **Time to Install**: Unknown\r\n  * **How**:\r\n    * If you are feeling brave, try this oldie but goodie: http://gizmodo.com/5257386/how-to-install-windows-7-on-almost-any-netbook\r\n    * Here's another: http://www.sevacall.com/blog/2013/04/s/computer-repair/install-windows-on-chromebook/\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Turn off OS Verification on Chromebooks\r\n\r\n  * **Description**: Allows you to experiment with the Chromebook by giving you access the developer's console and OS services. \r\n  * **Time to Complete**: 5 - 10 minutes\r\n  * **FYI**: This process does wipe your machine of any local data. But being a cloud-based device, any data in Google services will be restored automatically upon reboot. \r\n  * **How**:\r\n    * Turn off Chromebook\r\n    * Press and hold <esc> + refresh (F3 key) + power button\r\n    * Release the power button but hold the others until you see an error prompt that says \"Chrome OS is missing or damaged\". Press Enter.\r\n    * At the next screen, you will be notified that OS verification is Off. Press <ctrl> + d\r\nDevice will now be wiped and in 3 to 10 minutes your Chromebook will restart\r\n    * **Done!** \r\n    * Note: Whenever your device reboots from now on, you will be prompted to turn OS verification on. Doing so will kill a kitten. You don't want to hurt a kitten, do ya? I didn't think so.\r\n\r\n### [Back to Top](#option-1-ultra-minimalist-setup)","google":"UA-44168418-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
